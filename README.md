## Description

This project is part of the DIT639 Cyber-Physical Systems and Systems of Systems course at Chalmers/GU. Our goal is to design, implement, and evaluate software features for a self-driving miniature vehicle in a simulated, data-driven environment. The project involves analyzing customer requirements, selecting appropriate algorithms, and developing components such as perception, control, and decision-making. The team works collaboratively using GitLab for version control and Ubuntu-based systems for development, with a strong focus on testing, documentation, and iterative improvement.
