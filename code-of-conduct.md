**Code of Conduct**

- Maintain professionalism and respect in all communications.

- Adhere to agreed timelines, project requirements and group guidelines.

**Group Collaboration Plan**

- Open Dialogue: Foster an environment where questions, concerns and issues are encouraged and addressed promptly.

- Shared Decision-Making: Involve all members in decisions, respecting different viewpoints and knowledge.

**Collaboration Approach**

1. Vertical Slicing

Implement vertical slicing by breaking down tasks into small, independent parts that can be worked on simultaneously. Each part should be complete and functional on its own, ensuring smooth progress without delays.

2. Task Issues

During meetings, collaboratively create task issues to clarify expectations, responsibilities and deadlines, ensuring all team members are aligned.

3. Task Selection

Each team member selects tasks based on expertise, interests and availability, promoting engagement, efficiency and motivation.

4. Gitlab Task-Tracking

Utilizing GitLab’s task-tracking system involves creating, assigning and monitoring tasks within a project. This ensures team alignment with project goals and progress tracking.

5. Template Guide

Use the template guides in wiki to follow the group's best practices.

**Keeping Everyone Informed**

- Hold regular team meetings to review contributions, address roadblocks and provide feedback.

- Use Discord for real-time updates, quick check-ins and discussions. Formal updates will be shared during scheduled meetings.

- Implement project management tools within Discord to track tasks and progress.

- Schedule regular check-ins to provide updates and feedback.

**Knowledge Transfer**

- Review completed tasks in meetings to share key details and insights. This helps the team learn from each other and ensures smooth progress.

  **Documentation in Gitlab:**

  - Who is responsible: A Documentation representative will be selected during weekly meeting and rotated on a weekly basis. The representative ensures decisions, changes and overall information is documented in Gitlab Wiki, issues and commits.

  - Follow-Up: The representative will check periodically that updates are being made appropriately, and follow up with team if anything is missing or is unclear.

**Communication Plan**

1. In-Person Meetings:

Meet in person once a week for detailed problem-solving, brainstorming, and to ensure everyone stays on track. This will take place on **Mondays**.

2. Digital Platforms:

Maintain daily communication through digital platforms for continuous progress and immediate resolution of minor issues. (Discord as main platform)

3. Check-ins:

Structured check-ins will be planned during monday meetings to streamline communication and task updates.

**Conflict Resolution**

1. **Conflict Prevention:**

   - Encourage early and honest communication to address misunderstandings before they escalate.

   - Establish clear roles, responsibilities and deadlines at the start of each task.

   - Treat mistakes/issues as learning opportunities, promoting a supportive environment rather than a hostile environment.

   - Urge team members to bring up concerns early so that potential conflict can be addressed proactively.

2. **Conflict Handling:**

   - Handle conflicts internally through open and respectful discussions

   - Establish clear guidelines for conflict resolution, ensuring fair and transparent handling of issues.

   - If a resolution can't be reached, address teacher for guidance.

**Responsible Use of LLMs**

1. **Guidelines for use:**

- Where/When to use:

  - Brainstorming or outlining solutions

  * Summarizing technical information or notes for clarity.

  * Generating draft content for non-sensitive documentation.

- Where/When NOT to use:

  - Handling or prompting with sensitive data

  - Relying entirely on LLM output without peer review and critical thinking.

2. **Documentation and Transparency:**

   - Document and track each LLM usage in Gitlab Wiki, connected with issue number and merge requests, specifying the purpose and the content generated. ([Link to Usage of LLMs in Wiki](https://git.chalmers.se/courses/dit638/students/2025-group-03/-/wikis/Usage-of-LLMs))

   - Ensure LLM outputs are reviewed and validated by at least one other member before integrating into the project.

3. **Ethical Considerations:**

   - Adhere to ethical standards, avoiding plagiarism or misuse of generated content.

**Improvements Implemented**

- GitLab Integration: Task-tracking systems set up to ensure goal alignment and monitor task progress effectively.

- Discord as a Project Management Tool: Utilizing Discord for structured task tracking, real-time updates, and scheduled check-ins.

- Regular Check-Ins: Scheduled updates and feedback sessions to improve communication and efficiency.

- Enhanced Documentation: Leveraging GitLab’s documentation feature to maintain a structured record of key decisions, changes, and implementations.
