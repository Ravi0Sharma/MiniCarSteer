Code of Conduct

Group Collaboration Plan

Collaboration Approach

Implement vertical slicing by breaking down tasks into small, independent parts that can be worked on simultaneously. Each part should be complete and functional on its own, ensuring smooth progress without delays.

During meetings, collaboratively create task issues to clarify expectations, responsibilities and deadlines, ensuring all team members are aligned.

Each team member selects tasks based on expertise, interests and availability, promoting engagement, efficiency and motivation.

Utilizing GitLab’s task-tracking system involves creating, assigning and monitoring tasks within a project. This ensures team alignment with project goals and  progress tracking.

Use the template guide in wiki to follow the group's best practices.

Keeping Everyone Informed

Hold regular team meetings to review contributions, address roadblocks and provide feedback.

Use Discord for real-time updates, quick check-ins and discussions. Formal updates will be shared during scheduled meetings.

Implement project management tools within Discord to track tasks and progress.

Schedule regular check-ins to provide updates and feedback.

Knowledge Transfer

Review completed tasks in meetings to share key details and insights. This helps the team learn from each other and ensures smooth progress.

Utilize GitLab’s documentation feature to maintain a knowledge base of key decisions and implementations.

Communication Plan

Meet in person once a week for detailed problem-solving, brainstorming, and to ensure everyone stays on track.

Maintain daily communication through digital platforms for continuous progress and immediate resolution of minor issues.

Schedule structured check-ins within Discord to streamline communication and task updates.
Conflict Resolution
Handle conflicts internally through open and respectful discussions.

If a resolution cannot be reached, escalate the issue to the teacher for guidance and mediation.

Establish clear guidelines for conflict resolution to ensure fair and transparent handling of issues.
Responsible Use of LLMs
Establish internal guidelines for using Large Language Models (LLMs) ethically.

Document and reference every instance of LLM usage to ensure transparency, ethical implementation, and accountability.

Ensure LLM outputs are reviewed and validated before integration into the project.
